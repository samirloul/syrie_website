        <p>Palmyra, known in Arabic as <em>Tadmur</em>, lies deep in the Syrian desert. For centuries, it thrived as an oasis and a vital crossroads of trade linking the Roman Empire with the great civilizations of the East. Famed for its majestic ruins and unique architecture, Palmyra is one of the world’s most iconic archaeological sites and a poignant symbol of cultural endurance.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Cultural Background</h3>
        <p>Palmyra rose to prominence in the first centuries AD as a key stop along the Silk Road — a wealthy caravan city connecting East and West. Its strategic location and entrepreneurial spirit transformed it into a bustling metropolis, adorned with colonnades, temples, tombs, and theatres. The city reached its zenith under Queen Zenobia in the 3rd century AD, when she rebelled against Rome and expanded Palmyra’s influence across the Near East. Its architecture beautifully blends Greco-Roman, Persian, and Semitic styles, reflecting its cosmopolitan character.</p>

        <p>In 1980, UNESCO designated Palmyra a World Heritage Site, honoring its exceptional historical and cultural value.</p>

        <h3>The War and Its Aftermath</h3>
        <p>During the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra suffered greatly. Extremist forces occupied the city in 2015 and 2016, destroying some of its most treasured monuments, including the Temple of Bel, the Temple of Baalshamin, and parts of the colonnaded street — shocking the world and highlighting the fragility of cultural heritage.</p>

        <p>Government forces, supported by international partners, eventually regained control. Since then, archaeologists and conservationists have been working tirelessly to document, stabilize, and restore what remains.</p>

        <h3>Current Situation (July 2025)</h3>
        <p>Today, Palmyra stands as a solemn yet hopeful place. Some areas remain inaccessible due to ongoing mine clearance and restoration, but sections of the ruins have reopened to visitors under supervision. UNESCO and Syrian authorities continue to coordinate efforts to protect and rebuild this extraordinary site. Palmyra has become a symbol of the enduring spirit of humanity to defend and rebuild its shared heritage.</p>

        <h3>Economy and Society</h3>
        <p>The modern town of Tadmur, next to the ruins, is slowly recovering. Families have begun to return, and small businesses serving workers and visitors are reopening. While tourism remains far below pre-war levels, heritage-based development offers hope for a gradual economic revival.</p>

        <h3>Key Landmarks and Attractions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temple of Bel:</strong> The grandest temple of ancient Palmyra, partially rebuilt after its destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Colonnaded Street:</strong> The iconic avenue lined with columns and arches, a hallmark of the city.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Palmyra remains a powerful reminder of the beauty humanity can create — and of the importance of safeguarding our cultural heritage. Its story continues to inspire those who believe in the resilience of culture, the power of memory, and the promise of restoration.</p>
