        <p>Hama, located in west-central Syria on the banks of the Orontes River, is celebrated for its scenic beauty and its iconic norias—giant wooden waterwheels that have become a symbol of the city. These norias, some of which date back to the medieval period, are an enduring testament to the ingenuity of Hama's people and their connection to the river.</p>

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>Hama has a history stretching back thousands of years. Archaeological evidence shows that the site has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. Throughout its long history, it has been part of the Hittite, Assyrian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic empires. The Great Mosque of Hama and the Al-Azmeh Palace are notable reminders of its Islamic and Ottoman past. The norias were originally constructed to lift water for irrigation, a system that helped sustain the fertile plains surrounding the city.</p>

        <h3>The War and Its Aftermath</h3>
        <p>Hama has endured significant challenges over the decades. The city witnessed heavy fighting in the 1980s during a violent uprising, and though it was affected during the recent Syrian conflict, it did not experience the same level of destruction seen in cities like Aleppo or Homs. Some neighborhoods and infrastructure were damaged, but much of the historic center, including several norias, survived intact or with minor damage.</p>

        <h3>Current Situation (July 2025)</h3>
        <p>By July 2025, Hama has largely stabilized and is focusing on reconstruction and cultural preservation. Efforts to restore and maintain the norias are ongoing, supported by local and international heritage organizations. The city has also seen the reopening of schools, markets, and cultural centers, and its riverside parks have become a gathering place for families and tourists alike. While the economy is still recovering, agricultural production and local crafts have resumed, contributing to the city’s resilience.</p>

        <h3>Economy and Society</h3>
        <p>Hama’s economy traditionally revolves around agriculture, particularly wheat, cotton, fruits, and vegetables grown in the surrounding fertile plains. The Orontes River remains crucial for irrigation. In addition, the city is known for its handicrafts, including textiles and woodwork. Local markets have begun to bustle again as life gradually returns to normal. The people of Hama take pride in their cultural heritage, and traditional music and festivals are slowly reviving.</p>

        <h3>Key Landmarks</h3>
