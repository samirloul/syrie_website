        <p>Quneitra (القنيطرة) is a city located on the Golan Heights, in southwestern Syria near the border with Israel. Once a bustling regional center, it is now a haunting landscape of ruins — a powerful symbol of war, loss, and Syrian perseverance.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Cultural Background</h3>
        <p>Before the Arab-Israeli wars, Quneitra was a thriving city with schools, mosques, churches, markets, and hospitals, serving as the administrative and economic hub of the Quneitra Governorate. It sat strategically on the Damascus–Tiberias road, making it an important link between Syria and Palestine.</p>

        <p>During the 1967 Six-Day War, Quneitra fell to Israeli forces. Although briefly returned to Syrian control during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, it was recaptured and subsequently destroyed by Israeli forces before being handed back under a UN-brokered disengagement agreement in 1974.</p>

        <p>Since then, the city has been left uninhabited and in ruins as a testimony to its tragic history, with signs warning visitors not to enter dangerous areas still present today.</p>

        <h3>The War and Its Aftermath</h3>
        <p>During the Syrian Civil War, the Quneitra Governorate again became a battleground, though the city proper remained largely untouched since it was already abandoned. After years of fighting in surrounding towns and villages, the Syrian government regained full control of the governorate in 2018.</p>

        <h3>Current Situation (July 2025)</h3>
        <p>As of July 2025, Quneitra remains largely as it was — an empty, destroyed city. The site is preserved as a monument and reminder of the costs of conflict and occupation. Syrian visitors and foreign delegations sometimes tour the city to witness the devastation firsthand, guided by government officials. Signs at the city entrance proclaim its role as “a city destroyed by Zionist aggression.”</p>

        <h3>Economy and Society</h3>
        <p>The nearby villages and towns have seen modest resettlement and farming activities resume, though the economic situation remains fragile. The Golan’s fertile land continues to support agriculture, particularly apples and cherries, though much of the plateau remains under Israeli control.</p>

        <h3>Key Landmarks and Attractions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quneitra Ruins:</strong> The abandoned streets, homes, hospital, and mosque serve as a stark open-air museum of destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Golan Heights Viewpoints:</strong> Scenic yet sobering views of the Golan plateau and Mount Hermon.</li>
            <li><strong>United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) Zone:</strong> The buffer area patrolled by UN peacekeepers since 1974.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Quneitra remains an indelible part of Syria’s national story — a place where memory, history, and identity converge in the silent testimony of its ruins. It reminds Syrians and visitors alike of the enduring costs of war and the value of sovereignty and peace.</p>
