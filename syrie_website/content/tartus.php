        <p>Tartus (طرطوس) is a picturesque port city on the Mediterranean coast of western Syria. Known for its mild climate, sandy beaches, and rich history, Tartus is a beloved destination for Syrians seeking relaxation and a connection to their country’s maritime heritage.</p>

        <h3>Historical and Cultural Background</h3>
        <p>Tartus traces its origins back to Phoenician times, when it was known as Antaradus, an important trading port of Arwad — the island just offshore. Throughout history, Tartus was fortified by the Byzantines and later became a key stronghold of the Crusaders, who called it Tortosa. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa, built by the Crusaders, still stands today and serves as a museum of Tartus’ long and varied past.</p>

        <p>The city has maintained its maritime culture for centuries, blending fishing traditions, seafaring trade, and modern urban life in a harmonious setting.</p>

        <h3>The War and Its Aftermath</h3>
        <p>Unlike much of Syria, Tartus was spared the worst of the Syrian Civil War. Its stability made it a haven for many internally displaced Syrians, leading to significant population growth and strain on infrastructure. Nonetheless, Tartus maintained its calm and continued to serve as an economic and cultural center for the region.</p>

        <h3>Current Situation (July 2025)</h3>
        <p>As of July 2025, Tartus thrives as a vital Syrian port and a growing tourist destination. The city’s beaches and seafood restaurants are once again attracting visitors, and reconstruction projects in nearby areas continue to improve infrastructure. Tartus also hosts Russia’s naval facility, underscoring its strategic importance on the Mediterranean.</p>

        <h3>Economy and Society</h3>
        <p>The city’s economy revolves around fishing, shipping, tourism, and agriculture in the fertile coastal plains. Olive oil production, citrus orchards, and fresh seafood are regional specialties. Tartus’ welcoming atmosphere and mild weather make it one of the most livable cities in Syria today.</p>

        <h3>Key Landmarks and Attractions</h3>
        <ul>
