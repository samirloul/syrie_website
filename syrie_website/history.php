                        <h3>Modern Syria: Post-Independence and Recent Developments</h3>
                        <p>Syria gained independence in 1946. The country went through various political phases, including the United Arab Republic with Egypt (1958-1961) and the Ba'ath Party rule from 1963. The period from 2011 onwards marked a significant shift with the onset of the Syrian Civil War, leading to widespread conflict, humanitarian crisis, and significant geopolitical involvement.</p>
                        <p>As of July 2025, Syria is undergoing a period of significant political transition following the fall of the previous regime. A new transitional government, formed in March 2025, is in place, aiming to stabilize the country and address the ongoing humanitarian challenges. International sanctions have been revoked by some major powers, and there is a cautious optimism for economic recovery, though the path remains fragile. Security challenges persist in various regions, and rebuilding efforts are underway in devastated cities like Aleppo and Homs.</p>
